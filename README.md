# Patrick Murphy — Architecture & Platform Enablement (Azure | Identity | IaC)

**TL;DR:** I lead architecture and engineering teams to turn standards into shipped platforms: reference designs → secure paved roads (IaC, identity, guardrails) → measurable adoption, reliability, and reduced operational risk.

## Portfolio domains
Representative areas captured here (sanitised). Each domain links to deeper artifacts (ADRs, runbooks, governance models, patterns).

| Domain | Folder | Focus |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Architecture | [`docs/enterprise/architecture/`](docs/enterprise/architecture/_index.md) | Decision records, review process and PoC guidance to speed safe design decisions |
| Leadership | [`docs/enterprise/leadership/`](docs/enterprise/leadership/_index.md) | Engineering leadership: career ladders, hiring, feedback, budgeting, vendor & team management |
| Identity | [`docs/enterprise/identity/`](docs/enterprise/identity/_index.md) | Active Directory & Microsoft Entra ID fundamentals, governance, hardening, federation, and runbooks |
| Network | [`docs/enterprise/network/`](docs/enterprise/network/_index.md) | Azure virtual networking, connectivity, DNS, egress, and security controls |
| AI / ML Enablement | [`docs/enterprise/ai-ml-architecture-and-enablement/`](docs/enterprise/ai-ml-architecture-and-enablement/_index.md) | Platform, governance, recipes & safe enablement for AI/ML (workspaces, copilots, RAG) |
| Data | [`docs/enterprise/data/`](docs/enterprise/data/_index.md) | Guidance for ingesting, storing and protecting enterprise data with operational controls |

## What I do
- **Run architecture as a product:** principles, tech radar, reference designs, ADR discipline.
- **Land it via platform engineering:** reusable IaC modules, policy guardrails, golden paths, SLO instrumentation.
- **Embed identity-first & least-privilege:** Entra/AD workflow design, RBAC/PIM integration, secure automation.

## Operating principles
- **Platform as a product:** paved roads over gates; docs & templates beat approvals.
- **IaC by default:** everything reviewable, repeatable, auditable.
- **Identity-centric:** least-privilege access, JIT, owned boundaries.
- **Decision quality:** ADRs + small, safe steps.
- **Measure outcomes:** adoption, reliability (SLOs), risk reduction (not vanity counts).

## Fit & engagement profile
| Best fit when you need | Probably not a fit if you want |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Architecture standards that become paved roads | A purely individual contributor with no remit to influence standards |
| Identity-first, IaC-driven delivery discipline | Policy slides without engineering follow-through |
| Cross-org alignment with measurable adoption | Procedural gatekeeping / approval boards |
