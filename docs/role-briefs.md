# Role Briefs

## Architecture Practice Leader
- Run the architecture function (principles, reference designs, ADRs, review cadence, tech radar).
- Partner with security, platform, and product to land guardrails as paved roads (IaC + policy-as-code).
- Outcomes: faster delivery, fewer surprises, better risk posture.

## Platform/Cloud Engineering Leader
- Lead engineers to build reusable modules, golden paths, and standards-compliant CI/CD.
- Embed identity-first guardrails (least-privilege/JIT) and measure adoption/SLOs.

## Principal/Distinguished Architect
- Own end-to-end decision quality and traceability; coach teams through ADRs and small, safe changes.
- Translate strategy into reference patterns developers adopt without friction.

## Principal/Distinguished Cloud Infrastructure Engineer
- Architect and land enterprise-ready cloud foundations (networking, compute, storage, edge) with secure multi-tenant landing zones.
- Ship paved roads: Terraform modules, policy-as-code, golden images, and environment baselines developers actually adopt.
- Drive reliability, resilience, and cost efficiency: SLOs/error budgets, capacity planning, autoscaling, and FinOps guardrails.
- Enforce identity-first controls (JIT/least-privilege, workload identities, key/secrets management) across data planes and pipelines.
- Partner with Security and Product to turn controls into automation and audit-ready evidence.


**Where I fit best**
- You want a leader who can **run the architecture practice and lead engineering teams**—turning standards into paved roads via platform engineering.
- You want a **formal architecture practice** that actually ships via platform engineering.
- You value **identity-first** and **IaC-driven** delivery, not policy slides that never land.
