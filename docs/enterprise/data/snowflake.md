## When to use

Use Snowflake when you need:
- Elastic, near-instant scaling of independent compute clusters (virtual warehouses) for mixed workloads (ELT, BI, ad hoc, ML feature prep).
- Strong multi-cluster concurrency without resource contention (services architecture separates storage, compute, services). 
- Time Travel & Fail-safe for data recovery and audit retention requirements.
- Cross-cloud / region data sharing & collaboration with minimal replication management.
- Secure, governed consumption layer atop raw data in ADLS / Blob via external, managed or hybrid stages.

*Private Link availability varies by region and account configuration.

### 1. Networking & Connectivity [1][2]
Use Azure Private Link (or Snowflake Private Connectivity) to avoid public ingress/egress. Restrict IP ranges with network policies; only allow corporate CIDRs / trusted service networks. For large file loads, stage data in ADLS Gen2 with role-based SAS / OAuth integration. Minimize cross-region egress by co-locating Snowflake account region with primary data lake region.

Key practices:
- External stages: use scoped credentials (Azure SAS, managed identity integration) not embedded keys.
- Avoid unnecessary COPY over WAN; perform transformation inside Snowflake to reduce data movement.

### 2. Identity & Access Control [3][4]
Leverage Entra ID for SSO (SAML/OAuth). Automate user/group lifecycle with SCIM. Enforce least privilege through role hierarchy: SYSTEM ROLES (SECURITYADMIN, USERADMIN) separate from functional/business roles. Use a “future grants” pattern per database & schema to reduce manual privilege drift. For service automation, prefer key pair auth or OAuth service principals with limited roles.

### 3. Data Architecture & Modeling [5][6]
Adopt layered databases/schemas (e.g., RAW, REFINED, SERVE) analogous to Bronze/Silver/Gold. Normalize naming conventions and tagging. Use variant columns sparingly—flatten semi-structured data as it stabilizes. Evaluate search optimization or clustering for large selective predicate tables. Document retention/time travel settings per layer (RAW short vs SERVE longer).

### 4. Ingestion & Integration [7][8]
For continuous micro-batch loads, prefer Snowpipe (auto-ingest via event notifications). Use COPY INTO for bulk backfills. Streams capture change deltas; Tasks orchestrate incremental merges (MERGE INTO target USING stream). Keep file sizes balanced (optimal 100–250 MB compressed) for parallelism. 

### 5. Performance & Cost Optimization [9][10]
Right-size warehouses: start small (XS/S) with auto-suspend (60–120s) & auto-resume; scale out (multi-cluster) for concurrency, scale up for single-query heavy workloads. Set resource monitors to alert & suspend on monthly credit thresholds. Avoid over-cloning databases (storage cost) without pruning older clones. Use query profiling to identify excessive re-scans (add result caching strategies or clustering/search optimization where justified).

### 6. Governance, Lineage & Observability [11][12]
Enable object tagging (classification, data owner, sensitivity). Use ACCESS_HISTORY & QUERY_HISTORY for lineage building and least-privilege validation. Centralize audit extracts to a dedicated GOVERNANCE database. Integrate with Purview for cataloging via Snowflake APIs. Track credit consumption by warehouse + tag; publish FinOps dashboards.

### 7. Security & Data Protection [2][13]
Implement Customer-Managed Keys (tri-secret secure) if regulatory requirements demand. Apply masking policies for PII columns; row access policies for jurisdictional segmentation. Periodically rotate stage credentials & secrets. Enforce TLS; block non-allowed IPs. Use object parameterization (e.g., DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS) consistently.

### 8. Resilience & Disaster Recovery [14][15]
Use Time Travel for logical recovery (define retention per layer). Fail-safe (non-configurable period) covers catastrophic internal failures; do not rely on it for routine restore. Replicate critical databases & account objects (roles, users) to secondary region; define a failover test cadence (quarterly). Document RPO/RTO targets and map them to replication lag & retention settings.

### 9. Multi-Region / Multi-Account Strategy [14][15]
Minimize proliferation of accounts; use separate accounts for strict regulatory isolation or geographic legal boundaries. Use data sharing (Provider/Consumer) instead of copying data to reduce duplication. For DR, pair primary & secondary regions; restrict writes in standby except periodic validation queries.

### 10. Advanced (Snowpark, Streams, Tasks, ML) [16][17]
Snowpark enables pushdown of transformations in Python/Scala/Java with secure sandboxing. Streams + Tasks provide orchestrated incremental pipelines—structure as small composable tasks with explicit dependencies. External Functions or Snowflake Cortex (if enabled) for ML scoring integration; for custom ML training, export curated sets or use Snowpark-optimized procedures.

### 11. Access Reviews & Operational Hygiene [3][4][11]
Quarterly automated diff: SHOW GRANTS vs intended matrix; unused roles (no recent QUERY_HISTORY usage) flagged for removal. Validate masking/row policies coverage; rotate service credentials. Confirm resource monitors active on all production warehouses.

### Quick Checklist
| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Private connectivity / network policies enforced |  |
| Entra ID SSO + SCIM provisioning |  |
| Role hierarchy & future grants codified |  |
| Layered schemas (RAW/REFINED/SERVE) defined |  |
| Snowpipe / Streams & Tasks for incremental ingestion |  |
| Warehouse auto-suspend/resume & resource monitors |  |
| Credit & storage FinOps dashboards |  |
| Masking / row access policies on sensitive data |  |
| Replication + documented DR runbook |  |
| Access review (grants, unused roles) completed |  |

### Common Pitfalls
- Always-on XL warehouses for light ad hoc queries → wasted credits.
- Large numbers of tiny files staged (under 10 MB) → ingestion inefficiency.
- Masking policies defined but not applied to all projection views.
- Overuse of VARIANT with no later normalization → performance drag.
- Forgotten resource monitor leading to surprise month-end overage.

### Adoption Roadmap
1. Foundations: Account, networking (Private Link), SSO, SCIM, baseline roles.
2. Data Architecture: Layered databases/schemas, naming, tagging, retention.
3. Ingestion Modernization: Snowpipe, Streams & Tasks, COPY tuning.
4. Governance & Security: Masking/row policies, tagging, ACCESS_HISTORY lineage.
5. Performance & Cost: Warehouse right-sizing, monitors, search optimization.
6. Advanced & DR: Snowpark pipelines, replication & failover testing, ML integration.

## Reference architectures

### Batch ELT with External Stages
Flow: ADLS Gen2 landing → External Stage (SAS / OAuth) → COPY INTO RAW tables → Transform (SQL / Snowpark) to REFINED → Publish SERVE views (secured) → BI (Power BI, Fabric) via direct SQL.
Controls: Tag lineage, masking policies on SERVE, resource monitor for transform warehouse. [5][7][9]

### Near Real-Time Ingestion (Snowpipe + Streams & Tasks)
Flow: Event-driven blob arrival (Azure Event Grid) → Snowpipe auto-ingest to RAW → Stream on RAW table → Task executes MERGE into REFINED incremental table → Downstream Task refreshes SERVE aggregated view.
Key Concepts: Streams maintain change offsets; tasks orchestrated with schedule or dependency. [7][8]

### Medallion‑Style Layering in Snowflake
Pattern: RAW (immutable, short retention) → REFINED (validated, conformed, modeling structures) → SERVE (aggregated marts, secure views). Optionally add SANDBOX schema for exploratory prototypes. [5][6]

### Data Sharing & Marketplace Pattern
Use Secure Data Sharing (Provider → Consumer) for partner consumption: publish curated SERVE shares without copying data. For inbound, create separate database, apply classification tags, and create governed views. [14][15]

### Feature Engineering & ML Pipeline (Snowpark)
Flow: REFINED tables → Snowpark transformations / feature engineering → Feature tables (SERVE.FEATURES) with version tagging → Export snapshot or call external inference service → Model scoring results written back to SERVE.PREDICTIONS.
Controls: Lineage through tags; masking on sensitive feature columns; warehouse sizing tuned for Snowpark concurrency. [16][17]
