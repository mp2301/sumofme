## What is EFT

Enterprise File Transfer (EFT) is the set of patterns, tools, and operational practices used to move files reliably and securely between systems, partners, and customers. EFT typically combines a transport protocol (SFTP, FTPS, AS2, HTTPS), authentication and authorization controls (keys, certificates, tokens), and operational features such as auditing, retries, routing, and quarantine.

EFT may be implemented using a small set of specialised components:

- Transfer gateway: a hardened endpoint that handles authentication, protocol translation, logging, and initial validation.
- Storage/service backend: per-customer or per-tenant storage with encryption and segregation.
- Orchestration/processing: event-driven or scheduled pipelines that validate, scan, transform, and route files to downstream systems.
- Management & audit: dashboards, logs, and workflows (often provided by MFT products) for visibility and governance.

### EFT vs ad-hoc file sharing

EFT focuses on repeatability, auditability, and operational controls; it is not the same as ad-hoc file sharing (email attachments, consumer file-share links) which lack automation, strong guarantees, and enterprise-grade controls.

## Common enterprise use cases for EFT
These use cases drive common non-functional requirements for EFT solutions: high availability, auditability, strong authentication, integrity verification, controlled retention, and operational monitoring.

- B2B partner exchanges: recurring transfers of invoices, purchase orders, EDI payloads and reconciliation files (often using AS2/AS4 or SFTP).
- Customer file onboarding: customers upload large batch files (reports, data extracts, or insurance claims) into a secure endpoint for processing.
- Bulk data ingestion and exports: periodic exports/imports for analytics, reporting, or data lake ingestion.
- Payment and payroll file exchanges: bank file transfers that require non-repudiation, integrity checks, and strict audit trails.
- Regulatory reporting: submitting periodic files to authorities with retention and proof-of-delivery requirements.
- Backup and disaster recovery synchronisation: scheduled secure replication of backups between datacenters or cloud regions.
- Log aggregation or telemetry handoffs: partners or collectors pushing compressed logs for central processing.
- Vendor integrations and legacy system bridges: connecting older systems that only support FTP/FTPS to modern pipelines via a transfer gateway.




## Scope of EFT

- Covers transport/protocol choices, operational controls, onboarding, security, monitoring, and compliance considerations.

## Common technologies and protocols
- SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol): widely used for interactive and automated file exchanges; supports key-based auth and strong ciphers.
- FTPS (FTP over TLS): useful for compatibility with legacy FTP clients while adding TLS encryption.
- AS2 / AS4 (Applicability Statement): common in B2B EDI exchanges for guaranteed delivery, receipts (MDNs), and non-repudiation.
- Managed File Transfer (MFT) products: commercial offerings (for example, Globalscape EFT, GoAnywhere, IBM Sterling) that add workflow, auditing, and connectors.
- Cloud-native options: cloud storage with secure transfer endpoints (Azure Blob Storage + SFTP, AWS Transfer Family, Google Cloud Transfer), private endpoints and SAS tokens for scoped access.
- HTTPS/REST + multipart uploads: for modern APIs where customers push/pull files over authenticated HTTPS, often with JSON metadata.


## When to choose which

- Internal / private transfers: prefer SFTP or cloud private endpoints when integrations are inside your network or between trusted partners.
- Customer-facing transfers: choose AS2 for EDI partners with transactional guarantees, or HTTPS/S3-type APIs for modern integrations; offer SFTP or FTPS for legacy customers.
- Large-scale/enterprise workflows: consider an MFT product when you need centralized visibility, complex routing, long-term retention, and operational workflow features.

## Security & design principles

- Encrypt in transit and at rest: enforce TLS (minimum strong ciphers), use encrypted storage, and mandate secure client configurations.
- Use mutual authentication where possible: key-based SFTP, client TLS certificates, or JWT-based API tokens to reduce password exposure.
- Network isolation: place transfer gateways in a hardened DMZ or use private endpoints with limited ingress rules; avoid exposing internal storage directly to the public internet.
- Principle of least privilege: grant the minimum storage and container permissions (role-based access), short-lived SAS/URL tokens for customer uploads.
- Segregate tenants/customers: use separate containers/paths and strict per-customer ACLs to avoid accidental data leakage.
- Integrity checks: require checksums (MD5/SHA) and verify on receipt; use content addressing for immutable artifacts.
- Anti-malware and quarantine: scan inbound files before processing; move suspicious files to a quarantine area and notify owners.
- Non-repudiation & audit trails: record transfer metadata, client identity, timestamps, and transfer receipts (AS2 MDNs, API logs).
- Retention & disposal: apply retention policies and secure deletion for sensitive transfers; document legal hold processes.


## Operational best practices

- Onboarding checklist for partners/customers:
  - Exchange endpoints and supported protocols.
  - Authentication method: SSH key, client cert, or API key/token.
  - Directory layout and filename conventions.
  - Expected file formats, size limits, compression, and checksum method.
  - SLA (delivery windows, retries) and escalation contacts.
  - Test account and exchange of test files before production.
- Monitoring & alerting:
  - Instrument transfer gateways with detailed logs, success/failure metrics, and alerts for repeated failures or suspicious activity.
  - Track transfer latency and queue depth; define SLOs for critical flows.
- Idempotency & retries:
  - Design consumer processing to be idempotent or include deduplication keys to handle retries safely.
  - Implement exponential backoff and limited retry attempts for transient failures.
- Automation & orchestration:
  - Use event-driven processing (storage events, webhooks) or scheduled ingestion jobs with clear backpressure handling.
  - Keep transfer workflows declarative and version-controlled.

## Organizational ownership & responsibilities

EFT touches security, networking, operations, product and legal. Clear ownership avoids gaps. Common ownership models and responsibilities:

- Platform / Infrastructure (often "Cloud Platform")
  - Owns transfer gateways, private endpoints, network isolation, and deployment of MFT components.
  - Responsible for capacity planning, backups, and platform-level monitoring.

- Security / InfoSec
  - Sets authentication standards (keys, certs, token lifetimes), encryption requirements, scanning and incident response playbooks.
  - Owns vulnerability management for third-party transfer software and integration with SIEM.

- Integration / Data Engineering
  - Owns ingestion pipelines, schema validation, checksums, idempotency safeguards, and downstream handoffs.
  - Implements processing runbooks and coordinates PoC work for automation.

- Application / Product Teams
  - Own the business contract with partners/customers, define file formats, acceptance criteria and SLAs.
  - Coordinate onboarding with Platform and Security.

- SRE / Operations
  - Operate day-to-day runbooks, on-call rotations, alerting rules, and incident playbooks for transfers.
  - Execute response steps (isolate credentials, preserve evidence) and run recovery drills.

- Legal / Compliance / Privacy
  - Defines retention, legal hold, contractual obligations, and data classification requirements.
  - Reviews third-party agreements and helps define SLA and breach-notification clauses.

- Vendor/Procurement / Vendor Management
  - Manages vendor selection, contract terms, support SLAs, and verifies vendor security posture (SOC2, pen-test results).

RACI guidance (summary)
- Responsible: Platform / SRE for operation; Integration for pipelines.
- Accountable: Product/Business owner for the service and SLAs.
- Consulted: Security, Legal, Vendor Management during onboarding and incident remediation.
- Informed: Support, Customer Success, Executive sponsors for major incidents and SLA breaches.

Practical tip: maintain a single on-call rotation and a small runbook (one page) that lists contact points, escalation paths, and the rapid-response checklist referenced earlier.


## Privacy, compliance & legal

- Data classification: treat file contents according to data sensitivity; apply additional controls (encryption keys, stricter retention) for regulated data.
- Regulatory frameworks: ensure the chosen transfer mechanism and storage comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) and retain necessary audit records.
- Contracts and SLAs: embed security, encryption, breach-notification, and liability clauses in partner/customer agreements.


## Testing & validation

- Test with representative payloads and network conditions (latency, bandwidth limits).
- Validate failure modes: partial uploads, interrupted transfers, malformed files.
- Run periodic recovery drills and verify that backups and retention policies are effective.


## Common pitfalls and mitigations

- Exposing storage accounts directly to customers: always use a transfer gateway or signed URLs rather than providing full storage credentials.
- Using passwords instead of keys/certificates: prefer keys or client certificates and rotate them regularly.
- Skipping anti-malware scanning: add scanning as early as possible in the pipeline.
- No visibility into transfers: centralize logs and use an MFT or SIEM integration for alerting and audits.

## Risks and wide spread exploitation

EFT endpoints are attractive targets because they often handle sensitive data and may accept large files or connections from many external partners; attackers will probe for weak configs, leaked credentials, and misrouted storage containers. Below are common threat scenarios, indicators of compromise, mitigations, and a short rapid-response checklist.

### Common threat scenarios
- Credential compromise: leaked SSH keys, API keys, or SAS tokens allow attackers to upload or download sensitive files.
- Misconfigured storage exposure: public containers, permissive ACLs, or accidentally embedded credentials in repos expose entire datasets.
- Malware and supply-chain: attackers use EFT channels to deliver backdoors, installers, or data exfiltration agents that later move laterally.
- Large-scale exfiltration: automated scripts abuse transfer endpoints to download many files quickly once credentials are obtained.
- Replay or duplicate attacks: retransmitted files or replayed requests cause duplicate processing, billing, or reconciliation errors.
- Abuse for hosting illegal content: open upload endpoints can be abused to host pirated material or contraband.
- Enumeration and brute force: attackers enumerate user accounts, directory structures or attempt password/credential brute force against gateways.

### Indicators of compromise (IoCs)
- Spike in transfer volume or unusually large downloads from a single credential or IP.
- Failed/successful authentication attempts from unexpected geographies or uncommon client agents.
- New or unknown client keys/certificates registered without onboarding records.
- High rate of file uploads followed by immediate deletion or movement to unexpected containers.
- Antivirus/AV alerts triggered on incoming files or a rise in quarantined items.
- Unexpected changes to ACLs, container policies, or retention settings.

### Mitigations (preventive controls)
- Enforce strong authentication: use SSH keys, client TLS certificates, or short-lived tokens; prohibit password auth for automation.
- Short TTL for shared tokens/URLs and scoped permissions (least privilege). Rotate keys and revoke unused credentials promptly.
- Rate limits and quotas per-client to prevent large-scale exfiltration and to surface anomalous behavior.
- Network controls: IP allowlists for known partners, use WAF in front of HTTP endpoints, and egress controls to limit lateral movement.
- Mandatory content scanning: anti-malware, file-type validation, and checksum verification before any automated processing.
- Segregation and encryption: per-customer containers, server-side encryption with CMKs, and separate service identities for processing pipelines.
- Hardened transfer gateways: up-to-date TLS, disable weak ciphers, and limit accepted protocol versions and client ciphers.
- Centralized logging and SIEM: stream transfer logs, auth events, and storage access logs to a SIEM for correlation and alerting.
- Require onboarding records and manual verification for new partner keys or certificates.

### Rapid response checklist (first 30â€“60 minutes)
1. Identify and isolate: block the suspicious credential and isolate the offending client IP(s) at the gateway or firewall.
2. Preserve evidence: snapshot logs, list recent transfers, and preserve copies of suspicious files in a quarantine area.
3. Revoke access: rotate or revoke exposed keys/tokens and invalidate any short-lived URLs.
4. Contain storage exposure: set container ACLs to private, remove public access, and apply temporary read-only or deny rules.
5. Scan and triage: run AV/IR tools on quarantined files and determine whether further containment (network segmentation) is needed.
6. Notify stakeholders: inform security, platform, and the relevant business owner; open an incident ticket with initial findings.
7. Remediate and recover: restore from known-good backups if needed, tighten onboarding processes, and rotate affected credentials.
8. Post-incident actions: perform root cause analysis, update runbooks, and implement controls to prevent recurrence (e.g., enforce token TTLs, add rate limits).

Short-term detection recipes
- Add alert rules for sudden spikes in outbound transfer volume or many downloads using a single credential.
- Alert on newly created client keys or certificates that lack onboarding metadata.
- Alert when quarantine count exceeds a threshold or when AV signatures are triggered repeatedly for related uploads.



## Example architecture patterns

- Customer upload (public-facing): HTTPS API or SFTP endpoint in a DMZ â†’ transfer gateway validates/authenticates â†’ quarantine & scan â†’ move to per-customer storage container (with encryption) â†’ event to processing pipeline.
- Private scheduled sync: Internal SFTP client / automation job â†’ private endpoint to cloud storage â†’ checksum verification â†’ downstream processing.


## Acceptance checklist (quick)

- Transport encrypted (TLS/SFTP) â€” Yes/No
- Auth method: keys/certs/tokens â€” documented
- Checksums enforced and verified â€” Yes/No
- Anti-malware scanning â€” Yes/No
- Per-customer segregation (containers/ACLs) â€” Yes/No
- Retention policy documented â€” Yes/No
- Monitoring & alerts configured â€” Yes/No
