# Tailscale

Tailscale is a modern, identity-aware mesh VPN built on WireGuard that simplifies secure connectivity between servers, VMs, and developer machines.

Summary:
- Uses WireGuard under the hood for efficient crypto and low-latency tunnels.
- Good fit for admin access, developer tooling, and small-scale hybrid connectivity where full Azure VPN/Site-to-Site is heavyweight.
