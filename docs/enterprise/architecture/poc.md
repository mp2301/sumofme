# Proof of Concept (PoC) guidance

PoCs help validate risky assumptions quickly and cheaply before investing in full delivery. They should be timeboxed, scoped to a hypothesis, and engineered just enough to test the key risk.

PoC checklist
- Objective: clear hypothesis or risk to validate.
- Scope: what will be built (minimal) and what will be mocked or excluded.
- Success criteria: measurable outcomes that prove or disprove the hypothesis.
- Owner and timeline: who runs the PoC and the cadence for updates.
- Artifacts: code repo, docs, short runbook for how to run, and a short demo.

When to stop a PoC
- Hypothesis proven or disproven.
- The PoC is taking too long or exceeding cost expectations and still not producing value.
