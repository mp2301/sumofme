# Chatbots

Practical guidance for designing, deploying and operating chatbots and conversational agents in an enterprise context.

Chatbots can improve customer experience, automate common support flows, and accelerate internal workflows. They also introduce risks: data leakage, hallucination, privacy and brand reputation issues. Treat chatbot projects as product integrations with clear scoping, governance and monitoring.

## When to build vs integrate

- Use an integrated SaaS assistant when the need is generic and data residency/control is low.
- Build or vet a custom solution when you need control over data, integration with internal systems, or strict auditability.

<!-- Patterns merged into Basic concepts & architecture -->

## Security, privacy & safety

Privacy & handling:

- Avoid sending PII/unredacted customer data to external models unless contractually allowed and logged.
- Implement input filters, PII redaction, and data minimization before sending to a model.
- Maintain a retention policy for conversation logs and vector stores; support legal hold and data subject requests.

Safety & trust:

- Use grounding sources and cite evidence when returning factual claims.
- Add confidence thresholds and degrade to a human handoff on low confidence or sensitive actions.
- Regularly evaluate outputs against a test-suite for hallucinations and safety regressions.

Security & abuse mitigation:

- Protect APIs and keys using managed identities and short-lived credentials.
- Rate-limit and detect anomalous traffic; quarantine suspicious sessions.
- Validate and harden any downstream actions (e.g., account changes) triggered by the bot.

## Basic concepts & architecture

Core components of a modern chatbot:

- Frontend / UI: web, mobile or messaging channel that collects user input and displays responses.
- Orchestration layer: routes requests, enforces auth/quotas, and calls the LLM and retrieval services.
- Retriever (vector search / semantic search): fetches relevant documents or snippets from an indexed corpus.
- Embeddings service: converts documents and queries into vector representations.
- Vector DB / semantic index: stores embeddings and supports nearest-neighbour queries.
- LLM / model endpoint: generates responses, optionally with retrieval evidence and function calls.
- Connectors & tools: downstream APIs for tickets, databases, identity, and other systems.
- Observability & ops: logging, metrics, alerts, and tooling for incident response.

Typical flow (high level):

User -> Frontend -> Orchestrator -> Retriever -> LLM -> Orchestrator -> Frontend

When using RAG: Retriever returns evidence that the LLM uses to ground answers; evidence ids should be surfaced with responses.

Common patterns:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): retrieval store (vector DB) + generation model grounded in your docs.
- Rules + fallback: deterministic flows for sensitive tasks with LLM responses for open text.
- Hybrid on-prem / cloud: keep sensitive stores in your VNet and call hosted models via protected egress.

---

## Common use cases

- Internal knowledge assistant: search across manuals, runbooks, and wikis to answer employee questions.
- Customer support bot: handle tier-1 requests, triage issues, and create tickets in the support system.
- Developer assistant: code search, repo summaries, and quick scaffolding (often integrated with Copilot-style tooling).
- Process automation: trigger internal workflows (provisioning, approvals) via function-calls with human approvals.
- Compliance and SOP lookup: quick access to regulatory or process steps for auditors and operators.

Each use case has different risk profiles â€” e.g., customer support may handle PII and needs stricter controls than a public-facing FAQ bot.

## How to build a chatbot on Azure

Below is a practical guide for building a chatbot using Microsoft Azure services and recommended patterns. This assumes you will use an LLM (Azure OpenAI or similar) and a retrieval layer for grounding.

### Minimal architecture (RAG)

```
User -> Channel (Web/Teams/Slack) -> API Gateway/Orchestrator ->
  -> Input filter/redaction -> Retriever (Vector index) -> LLM (Azure OpenAI) ->
  -> Output filter -> Channel

Supporting components:
- Indexing pipeline: data ingestion, embedding generation, vector index updates
- Storage: blob/object store for raw docs, metadata store for sources
- Auth & secrets: Entra ID, Key Vault, Managed Identity
- Ops: App Insights, Log Analytics, runbooks
```

### Azure services mapping

- Channel/Frontend: static web on Azure Static Web Apps, Power Virtual Agents, Microsoft Teams app, or custom frontends hosted in App Service / AKS.
- Orchestration/API: Azure Functions, Azure API Management, or App Service.
- Embeddings & model: Azure OpenAI (embeddings endpoints, Chat Completions / function-calling) or vendor APIs behind a secure egress.
- Vector index / semantic search: Azure Cognitive Search (vector search), or hosted vector DBs in AKS (Milvus) or managed services.
- Storage: Azure Blob Storage for documents, Cosmos DB or Azure SQL for metadata and conversation logs if retention requires relational storage.
- Secrets & identity: Azure Key Vault + Managed Identity; Entra ID for user authentication and SSO.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps Pipelines for builds, tests, and deployments.
- Observability: Application Insights + Log Analytics + Workbooks for dashboards; Azure Monitor alerts for SLOs.
- Runbooks & automation: Azure Automation, Logic Apps, or durable Functions for operational playbooks.

### Step-by-step build checklist

1. Scoping & data classification
	- Classify the data the bot will touch. Block PII from being sent to public models unless contractually permitted.
	- Define success criteria and SLOs (e.g., resolution rate, escalation rate, latency).

2. Prototype: simple Q&A
	- Ingest a small document set into Blob Storage.
	- Generate embeddings with Azure OpenAI embeddings and store them in Azure Cognitive Search (or a vector DB).
	- Build a tiny orchestrator (Azure Function) that accepts a query, retrieves top-k docs, calls the LLM with context, and returns the answer.

3. Add channel & auth
	- Expose the orchestrator via Azure API Management or directly behind App Service with Entra ID auth.
	- Integrate with the chosen channel (Teams/Slack/Web) and add user identity where required.

4. Hardening: safety & filtering
	- Add input redaction and PII filters before embeddings or model calls.
	- Implement an output safety filter or hallucination check; route low-confidence answers to human reviewers.

5. Scale & infra
	- Move ingestion to a pipeline (Azure Functions / Durable Functions) that batches embedding generation and updates the index.
	- Host retrieval and orchestrator with scaling (App Service/AKS). Monitor costs for vector queries and inference.

6. CI/CD, testing & governance
	- Add unit tests for prompt templates and synthetic queries for high-risk flows.
	- Automate deployments with GitHub Actions; include a canary stage that runs smoke tests for accuracy and hallucination checks.

7. Observability & ops
	- Log prompts (metadata only where privacy allows), model-id, and retrieval evidence ids to Log Analytics.
	- Create Workbooks dashboards with SLOs and an on-call runbook that references automated recovery steps.

### Security & governance checklist

- Store keys in Key Vault and use Managed Identities for services.
- Require Entra ID SSO for admin tooling and use Conditional Access policies for management consoles.
- Enforce Azure Policy to prevent unapproved region or SKU usage for data stores.
- Encrypt vector stores at rest and secure network access with private endpoints or VNet integration where possible.
- Keep an audit trail (who ran what prompt and which model/version) for high-risk workflows and retain per-policy.

---

## Observability & operational readiness

- Log prompts, responses (where permitted), model-id, and retrieval evidence for audit and troubleshooting.
- Track KPIs: accuracy, escalation rate, user satisfaction, latency, cost per session.
- Define an incident playbook: isolate model keys, pause ingestion, and preserve logs for investigation.
- Run regular regression tests for hallucination and coverage; track model drift over time.
- Maintain a human-in-the-loop pathway for any action that changes customer state.

---


### Practical quick wins (Azure)

- Automate reindexing runbooks and expose a guarded "reindex" operation for operators (reduce manual interventions).
- Replace ad-hoc credential sharing with Key Vault references and Managed Identities for ingestion and runtime services.
- Add an automated smoke-test that runs after model or index updates and gates promotion if hallucination or coverage regressions are detected.
- Track costs with Azure Cost Management and set budgets/alerts for ingestion and inference spending.
