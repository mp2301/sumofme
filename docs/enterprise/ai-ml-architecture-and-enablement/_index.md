# AI / ML Architecture & Enablement

Renamed from `ai` to clarify broader scope: platform architecture, model lifecycle governance, enablement patterns (Copilot, RAG, secure workspaces) and practical recipes.

This section collects practical guidance for AI/ML platforms, model governance, and safe developer tooling.
Content is grouped into platform/tooling entries and patterns/recipes so it's easier to scan.

## Platform & tools
