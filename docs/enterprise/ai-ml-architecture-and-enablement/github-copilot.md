## Copilot licensing and entitlements

What to consider:

- Evaluate GitHub Copilot for Business (or equivalent enterprise offering) for org-wide SSO, admin controls and centralized billing.
- Confirm licensing model: per-user seats vs pooled access, renewal cadence, and audit/reporting capabilities.
- Check data-use options: enable or disable vendor training on your codebase where the provider allows it.

Operational checklist:

- Map which teams need Copilot vs who only needs access to the API or internal assistants.
- Ensure procurement includes contractual language for data handling, IP ownership, and incident response.
- Centralise billing and entitlement management (avoid ad-hoc personal subscriptions).

Enterprise note: Prefer provider enterprise plans that support SSO, org-level policy controls, and explicit opt-out of training on private code when required.

## Sensitive code detection and policy

Goals: prevent secrets, regulated data, or privileged logic from being exposed to model suggestions or training data.

Policy elements:

- Define "sensitive code" (secrets, PII, crypto keys, proprietary algorithms, customer data formats) and list repositories or directories where Copilot is disallowed.
- Enforce repository-level controls: use branch/PR protections, repository settings to limit third-party tools, and org policies where possible.
- Automate detection: run secret scanners (pre-commit and CI), static analysis, and pattern-based detectors to block commits containing credentials or other sensitive artifacts.

Implementation notes:

- Add pre-commit hooks and CI gates that fail builds when secrets are detected; treat failures as blocking until remediated.
- Use a combination of automated tooling and human review for flagged findings; ensure a rapid remediation path for high-severity leaks.
- Maintain an allowlist for codebases where Copilot is permitted and a denylist for repositories that must never be used with Copilot (e.g., regulated or classified projects).

## IDE configuration and guardrails

Developer-facing controls can reduce accidental leakage and improve signal-to-noise for suggestions.

Recommended settings and practices:

- Configure the IDE (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.) at the workspace or policy level to set sensible defaults (e.g., suggestion behavior, inline completions, telemetry preferences).
- Provide an approved configuration template that can be distributed via dotfiles or enterprise Workspace Extensions to ensure consistent behavior.
- Expose a clear toggle and documentation for disabling Copilot per-workspace; ensure developers know how to opt-out for sensitive work.

Tooling suggestions:

- Integrate Copilot with linters and formatters so suggested code follows style and security rules before it reaches CI.
- Use extension configuration for suggestion filtering if supported (e.g., disable code generation in particular languages or folders).

Developer ergonomics: Document how to request or revoke access, and publish a short FAQ that covers where Copilot is allowed, how suggestions are logged, and how to report harmful suggestions.

## Training & best practices for developers

Make safe, effective use of Copilot part of your developer lifecycle.

Core guidance:

- Treat Copilot suggestions like external input: always review and test before merging. Require human review on all PRs that include generated code.
- Authors should add provenance comments for non-trivial generated snippets (e.g., "generated-by: copilot, prompt: <short description>") to aid future audits.
- Run generated code through standard security checks (SAST), dependency scanning, and unit tests before approving.

Training and enablement:

- Run short hands-on sessions that teach developers: how Copilot works, when to trust it, how to redact sensitive inputs, and effective prompting patterns.
- Provide a small library of vetted prompt templates and common request formats (e.g., unit-test generation, refactors, docstring writing) to reduce risky freeform prompts.
- Encourage pair-programming or code review checkpoints for early adopters; capture common gotchas and update onboarding docs.

Quick checklist for PR reviewers:

- Verify there are no secrets or hard-coded credentials.
- Confirm generated code has tests and meets code style and security requirements.
- Confirm the commit message or code comment documents that Copilot was used (where policy requires disclosure).
