# EntraID AD Services and Integration

EntraID (formerly Azure Active Directory) provides cloud-based identity and access management. EntraID AD Services allow organizations to extend or synchronize their on-premises Windows AD with EntraID, enabling hybrid identity solutions.

## Integration Methods
- **Azure AD Connect:** Synchronizes users, groups, and passwords between Windows AD and EntraID.
- **Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users can access cloud and on-premises resources with one identity.
- **Federation:** Enables advanced authentication scenarios using AD FS or third-party providers.

## Benefits
- Centralized identity management for cloud and on-premises resources
- Enhanced security with conditional access and multi-factor authentication
- Simplified user experience and administration

Proper integration ensures secure, unified access across environments and supports modern cloud applications while maintaining compatibility with legacy systems.

## EntraID AD Domain Services

Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AADDS), now part of EntraID, provides managed domain services such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos/NTLM authentication in the cloud, without the need to deploy domain controllers.

AADDS creates a managed domain in Azure, allowing you to:
- Join Azure VMs to the domain
- Use legacy authentication protocols (Kerberos, NTLM)
- Apply Group Policy to cloud resources
- Enable LDAP for applications

**How AADDS Works:**
- AADDS is provisioned as a managed service in an Azure virtual network.
- Users and groups are synchronized from EntraID (Azure AD) or on-premises AD via Azure AD Connect.
- No domain admin or enterprise admin privileges are granted; management is done through Azure portal and EntraID.

**Limitations:**
- No direct write-back to on-premises AD
- Some advanced AD features (like schema extensions) are not supported
- Changes to users/groups must be made in the source directory (EntraID or on-prem AD)

AADDS is ideal for lift-and-shift scenarios, legacy app support, and hybrid cloud environments where you need domain services but do not want to manage domain controllers in Azure.

**Key Features:**
- Managed domain controllers (no patching or maintenance required)
- Domain join for VMs and services in Azure
- LDAP and Kerberos/NTLM authentication support
- Group Policy support for cloud resources
- High availability and automatic backups

**Use Cases:**
- Lift-and-shift legacy applications to Azure that require domain join
- Enable authentication for cloud-based workloads without on-premises AD
- Simplify hybrid identity management

**Integration with EntraID and Windows AD:**
- Synchronize users and groups from EntraID or on-premises AD using Azure AD Connect
- Use EntraID AD Domain Services for authentication and policy management in Azure
- No direct write-back to on-premises AD; changes must be made in the source directory

EntraID AD Domain Services is ideal for organizations moving workloads to Azure or needing domain services in the cloud without the overhead of managing domain controllers.

## LDAPS with Azure AD Domain Services (AADDS)

Azure AD Domain Services (AADDS) supports LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS), enabling secure directory queries and authentication for applications and services in Azure.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Integrate legacy applications that require LDAP authentication
- Enable secure directory lookups for apps and services in Azure
- Support third-party identity and access management tools

**How to Use LDAPS with AADDS:**
- LDAPS is enabled by default on AADDS managed domains
- Connect to the managed domain using the secure LDAPS endpoint (port 636)
- Use domain credentials for authentication
- Ensure client applications trust the AADDS SSL certificate (downloadable from Azure portal)

LDAPS enables secure, standards-based integration for applications that need directory access in Azure environments.
