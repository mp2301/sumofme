## Product Overview

Active Roles ([by Quest](https://www.quest.com/products/active-roles/)) is an enterprise tool that simplifies and secures Active Directory management, including user provisioning, group management, attestation, and compliance.

## Licensing for Active Roles

Active Roles is a commercial product and requires appropriate licensing from Quest Software.

**Key Points:**
- Licensing is typically based on the number of managed users or objects
- Different editions and add-ons are available depending on feature requirements
- Contact Quest or an authorized reseller for pricing and quotes
- Ensure compliance with license terms to avoid service interruptions

## Key Features
- Delegated administration with granular permissions
- Automated user and group provisioning
- Attestation workflows for group membership and privileged access
- Policy enforcement for password, group, and account standards
- Integration with compliance frameworks (HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)
- Audit logging and reporting for all changes
- Multi-forest & untrusted domain management (no trust required for consistent policy enforcement)
- Hybrid identity extension: coordinate with Entra ID (Azure AD) provisioning flows for cloud-first → on-prem augmentation
- Admin / privileged object synchronization across perimeter or isolated forests

## How Active Roles Facilitates AD Governance
- Owners can be assigned and notified for security groups
- Membership requests and approvals can be automated
- Attestation cycles can be scheduled and tracked
- Automated enforcement of group owner and membership policies
- Integration with CyberArk for privileged account management
- Supports onboarding and compliance automation with scripts and templates
- Provides a controlled layer to project Entra ID identities into legacy / segmented forests while preserving least privilege

## Hybrid Integration with Entra ID & Untrusted Domains

Active Roles can participate in a hybrid model with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) to unify lifecycle management and privileged administration across:

- The primary on-premises AD forest(s)
- Disconnected / perimeter or DMZ forests (no or limited trust)
- Legacy or acquisition forests where establishing trusts is not desirable

### Integration Pattern
1. Authoritative identity originates in HR → flows to Entra ID (cloud-first) via inbound provisioning / HR connector.
2. Entra ID → On-premises AD sync (e.g., Entra Connect) creates / updates the core user object in the primary forest.
3. Active Roles applies provisioning policies (naming, group assignment, controlled OU placement, tier tagging) to the AD account.
4. For untrusted or perimeter forests, Active Roles synchronization / scripting workflows create shadow/admin accounts & role-based groups (e.g., break-glass, service, Tier 0) without requiring inter-forest trust.
5. Changes (role updates, deprovision events) are propagated through Active Roles policies and optional outbound scripts to each isolated forest.

### Synergies & Benefits
- **No Trust Required:** Push a minimal set of admin / service objects into untrusted domains while keeping credential lifecycle centralized.
- **Consistent Role Model:** Enforce the same tiering (Tier 0 / 1 / 2) and naming conventions across all forests; Active Roles templates ensure uniform prefixes/suffixes.
- **Privileged Access Hygiene:** Combine Entra ID PIM (just-in-time role activation) with Active Roles controlled group membership injection for on-prem AD groups; ephemeral elevation can be scripted to expire / remove after window.
- **Segregation of Duties:** Keep HR → Entra ID identity birth separate from on-prem privilege augmentation (handled by Active Roles), reducing blast radius of cloud misconfiguration.
- **Automated Decommission:** Disable / move to quarantine OU across every forest in a single workflow when Entra ID or HR marks a user as terminated.
- **Audit & Attestation:** Cross-forest membership consolidation exported from Active Roles for periodic review, correlating with Entra ID access reviews.
- **Shadow Admin Accounts:** Automatically create distinct, non-mail-enabled admin accounts (no mailbox, no cloud sync) in isolated forests linked (via metadata or tag) to the primary identity for traceability.

### Typical Hybrid Use Cases
- Create & maintain read-only service accounts in an external (supplier) forest used for one-way data ingestion without exposing internal trusts.
- Replicate a standardized “Privileged Access” OU (with groups and GPO link placeholders) into multiple acquisition forests; populate groups based on Active Roles policies referencing primary forest attributes.
- Generate and rotate complex passwords for isolated admin accounts; store secrets in cyber vault; reflect rotation status back as a tagged attribute.

### Implementation Notes
- Map Entra ID roles / security groups to Active Roles policies via attribute triggers (extensionAttribute / department / role code).
- Use scripting policy (PowerShell) for cross-forest object creation where native connectors are not available; ensure secure credential handling (managed service accounts or gMSA where feasible).
- Maintain a metadata table (SQL / configuration DB) for forest mapping to drive provisioning logic and minimize hard-coded values.
- Log every cross-forest provisioning action; forward logs to SIEM with forest identifier for correlation.

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Drift between Entra ID group intent and on-prem group membership | Scheduled reconciliation job via Active Roles reporting + removal workflow |
| Stale shadow admin accounts in untrusted forests | Expiration attribute & periodic disable/remove policy |
| Overprovisioning due to broad attribute triggers | Narrow attribute scoping; introduce approval step for privileged templates |
| Credential sprawl for connectors | Centralized credential vault + short-lived access tokens / gMSA |

> Reference: Consult Quest Active Roles hybrid / synchronization feature documentation for supported connectors & scripting interfaces.

## Example Use Cases
1. Automate quarterly attestation for all security groups, notifying owners and tracking responses
2. Enforce three-owner policy for privileged groups, with automated reminders and deletion workflow
3. Integrate with SIEM/Sentinel for real-time audit and compliance reporting
4. Provision and deprovision users based on HR system changes, with full audit trail
5. Push shadow admin accounts & least-privilege groups into an untrusted perimeter forest without establishing a trust
6. Coordinate Entra ID PIM elevation with temporary on-prem group membership injection and automatic rollback

Active Roles streamlines AD operations, reduces manual effort, and strengthens security and compliance across the environment.

## Typical Screens and Workflows

**Attestation Dashboard:**
- Displays all groups requiring attestation, current status, and owner actions.
- Owners can review, approve, or remove members directly from the dashboard.

**Group Management Screen:**
- Shows group membership, ownership, and approval history.
- Owners can add/remove members, assign new owners, and view audit logs.

**Example Workflow: Quarterly Attestation**
1. Owners receive automated email notification for attestation.
2. Log in to Active Roles web interface and navigate to the Attestation Dashboard.
3. Review group membership and approve or remove members as needed.
4. Submit attestation; actions are logged for compliance.

**Example Workflow: Membership Request**
1. User requests membership via self-service portal.
2. Owners receive notification and approve/deny request in the Group Management Screen.
3. Approved members are added automatically; all actions are logged.

Active Roles supports backup and recovery of its configuration, policies, and workflows to ensure business continuity and rapid restoration in case of failure or disaster.

**Key Points:**
- Regularly back up Active Roles configuration database and custom policies
- Document and automate backup schedules using built-in tools or scripts
- Store backups securely and test recovery procedures periodically
- In case of failure, restore the configuration database and reapply customizations

**References:**
- [Active Roles Backup and Restore Guide (support landing)](https://support.quest.com/)

Proper backup and recovery planning ensures minimal disruption and quick recovery of AD management capabilities.
