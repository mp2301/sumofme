# Feedback: leadership, peers, and customers

Purpose
- Clarify feedback types, cadence, and use so teams get actionable, balanced input.

Overview
- Feedback is not a single process: leadership feedback, peer feedback, and customer feedback serve different purposes and should be collected and used differently.

## Leadership feedback
- Purpose: performance calibration, career coaching, and strategic alignment.
- Sources: manager, skip-level, executive sponsors.
- Cadence: regular 1:1s, quarterly reviews, ad-hoc coaching.
- How to use: set development goals, unblock resources, and decide promotions or reassignments.

## Peer feedback
- Purpose: day-to-day collaboration, code reviews, and behavioral signals.
- Sources: teammates, cross-functional partners.
- Cadence: continuous (pull-request reviews, retros, periodic peer reviews).
- How to use: surface collaboration issues early, inform calibration panels, and create targeted development plans.

## Customer feedback
- Purpose: validate product decisions, measure user impact, and surface real-world issues.
- Sources: product telemetry, NPS, user interviews, support tickets.
- Cadence: continuous with structured windows for deep interviews.
- How to use: prioritise roadmap items, adjust acceptance criteria, and inform UX and product decisions.

Best practices
- Make feedback timely, specific, and evidence-based.
- Separate performance evaluation from one-off negative incidents; favour coaching.
- Close the loop: show how feedback led to changes.
- Protect psychological safety: anonymise sensitive peer/customer inputs when required.
