# Career ladders (leadership guidance)

Purpose
- Provide a repeatable framework for defining roles, expectations, and progression within engineering and product teams.

Principles
- Make expectations explicit: list competencies, behaviors, and measurable outcomes for each level.
- Separate scope from seniority: distinguish influence/impact from years of service.
- Include technical, delivery, and leadership dimensions.
- Design for mobility: allow lateral moves and craft paths for IC and management tracks.

Core sections to include in a ladder
- Title and level definition (example: Engineer II, Senior Engineer, Staff)
- Competencies (technical skill, system design, execution, mentorship)
- Expected outcomes (deliverables, scope, autonomy)
- Success signals (measurable indicators for promotion)
- Typical interview/assessment questions and evidence
- Recommended development activities

Practical steps for leadership
1. Start with 3-5 canonical levels and test with a pilot team.
2. Draft competency language, then validate with managers and a small cross-functional panel.
3. Share a one-page summary for each level and collect feedback for 2-4 weeks.
4. Publish with an FAQ and iterate quarterly.

Templates & artifacts
- Provide a promotion checklist and evidence matrix.
- Include sample role profiles and a mapping to market benchmarks.
