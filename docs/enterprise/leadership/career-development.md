Key patterns
- Development Plans: 90-day and 12-month plans with specific outcomes and success metrics.
- Learning loops: structured practice, feedback, reflection, and repeat.
- Stretch assignments: identify work that pushes skills while keeping the team productive.
- Mentorship and sponsorship: pair mentoring with active advocacy for opportunities.

Manager responsibilities
- Co-create goals and ensure the individual has time and runway for development.
- Provide regular feedback and remove blockers.
- Advocate for opportunities and fair recognition.

Individual responsibilities
- Own skill development, seek feedback, and demonstrate progress through outcomes.
- Keep a lightweight portfolio of work and learning artifacts.

Practical templates
- 90-day plan: goal, activities, evidence, checkpoints.
- Promotion evidence matrix: link activities to ladder competencies.

Metrics to track
- Skill growth (self/peer assessments)
- Impact (projects delivered, customer metrics)
- Mobility (internal moves, promotions)

Next steps for leadership
