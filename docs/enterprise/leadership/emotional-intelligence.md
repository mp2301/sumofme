# Emotional intelligence for leaders

Purpose
- Describe the practical competencies of emotional intelligence (EQ) for people leaders and provide exercises to build them.

What is EQ?
- Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify, understand, and manage your own emotions and those of others.
- Popular model: Self-awareness, Self-regulation, Motivation, Empathy, Social skills.

Why it matters for leadership
- Improves team cohesion, reduces conflict, and increases psychological safety.
- Helps leaders give constructive feedback, read team morale, and coach effectively.

Core competencies and examples

- Self-awareness
  - Notice emotional triggers (stress, frustration) and how they affect decisions.
  - Practice: post-meeting reflection — what feelings emerged and why?

- Self-regulation
  - Pause before reacting, use breathing or micro-breaks, and choose responses deliberately.
  - Practice: the 10-second rule before responding in heated conversations.

- Motivation
  - Connect work to purpose; model resilience and focus on outcomes over blame.
  - Practice: share short narratives of impact during team syncs.

- Empathy
  - Listen to understand, not to reply. Validate emotions without immediately problem-solving.
  - Practice: summarize the other person's view before proposing solutions.

- Social skills
  - Build relationships across teams, influence without authority, and resolve conflict with curiosity.
  - Practice: structured check-ins and rotating peer shout-outs.

Practical exercises for leaders
- Weekly reflex: identify one emotion you felt each day and what triggered it.
- Role-play feedback sessions with peers and use the SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) model.
- 1:1 agenda that starts with a mood check and ends with an action and support ask.
- Run "temperature checks" (anonymous pulse or quick polls) after significant changes.

Using EQ in common leadership moments
- Hiring interviews: observe responses to situational questions and how candidates reflect on failures.
- Performance conversations: lead with observations and impact, then explore motivations and solutions.
- Incidents/outages: keep communication calm, assign clear next steps, and hold a human-focused retrospective.

Resources
- Daniel Goleman, Emotional Intelligence (book)
- The SBI feedback model: Situation — Behavior — Impact
- Practice: weekly peer coaching groups or external coaching for leaders
