# Flexing your style: adapting to other people's personality types

Purpose
- Practical guidance for leaders and teammates on adapting communication and collaboration styles to be more effective across diverse personality types.

Simple taxonomy (practical)
- Direct / Task-oriented
  - Focus: decisions, outcomes, speed.
  - Signs: short answers, asks "what's the decision?", dislikes long meetings.

- Analytical / Detail-oriented
  - Focus: data, correctness, logic.
  - Signs: asks clarifying questions, wants docs/diagrams, cautious about assumptions.

- Amiable / Supportive
  - Focus: relationships, stability, consensus.
  - Signs: values harmony, seeks reassurance, prefers collaborative discussion.

- Expressive / Big-picture
  - Focus: vision, connections, enthusiasm.
  - Signs: tells stories, moves quickly between ideas, likes brainstorming.

Why flexing matters
- Improves clarity, reduces friction, and speeds decisions.
- Builds psychological safety by showing respect for others' preferred ways of working.
- Helps leaders get buy-in and reduce misunderstandings in cross-functional work.

Quick adaptation patterns
- To Direct people
  - Be concise. Lead with the ask and outcome.
  - Give options with a recommended choice and a short rationale.
  - Keep meetings short and action-focused; follow up with a one-line summary.

- To Analytical people
  - Share data, diagrams, and assumptions up-front.
  - Allow time for questions and follow-up; avoid surprise decisions.
  - Provide written notes and references after discussions.

- To Amiable people
  - Start with context and alignment; acknowledge concerns.
  - Invite input and confirm how the change affects people.
  - Use one-to-one conversations for delicate topics.

- To Expressive people
  - Link the ask to the broader vision and impact.
  - Capture ideas during brainstorming and convert them into concrete next steps.
  - Use short, energetic check-ins and keep momentum with visible progress.

Meeting & collaboration tips
- Start with a one-line executive summary for mixed audiences (decision or question + why).
- Use an agenda that maps to different styles: Quick decision, Data / Detail, People/impact, Open brainstorm.
- For important decisions, provide a short doc and allow 24â€“72 hours for review (handles analysts and amiable reviewers).
- Rotate facilitation: let different personality styles lead parts of the meeting to keep balance.

Feedback and difficult conversations
- Prepare: identify the other person's likely style and frame the feedback accordingly.
- Use SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) with Direct and Analytical people; add supportive coaching with Amiable people.
- With Expressive people, surface behaviour impact quickly and invite solutions.
- Always close with a forward-looking action and offer support.

Exercises and team norms
- Team map: each person identifies their primary and secondary styles; share a one-line preference ("I prefer short decisions; send me the doc after").
- Role-play: practice delivering feedback using different styles.
- Meeting checklist: set a two-sentence summary and an explicit decision or next step at the end of every meeting.

Pitfalls to avoid
- Stereotyping: styles are preferences, not fixed identities.
- Over-adapting: don't lose authenticity; aim for a short adaptation and return to your strengths.
- Ignoring minority styles: ensure quieter voices get space (use round-robin or written inputs).

Leader responsibilities
- Model flexing in public settings and praise team members who adapt effectively.
- Provide time for analysts to review, and set expectations for rapid decisions when needed.
- Create norms for meeting length, agenda structure, and follow-up summaries.

Resources & reading
- Short practices: SBI feedback, one-line summaries, meeting agendas that include "decision" and "data".
