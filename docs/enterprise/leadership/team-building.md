# Team-building activities

Practical, low-friction activities engineering leaders can run to build trust, psychological safety, and cross-team collaboration. Each activity includes remote-friendly variants and a suggested duration.

## Goals

- Build relationships and empathy across roles.
- Surface and solve working friction early.
- Create rituals that reinforce learning, celebration, and alignment.

## Short activities (15–45 minutes)

- Lightning introductions (15 min): quick round where each person shares name, role, and one non-work fun fact. Remote: use chat or a shared whiteboard.
- Show-and-tell (20–30 min): team members demo a small project or a learning. Encourages knowledge sharing and lowers fear of presenting.
- Pair puzzle (30 min): small pair programming or logic puzzle in rotating pairs. Great for onboarding and cross-skilling.
- Appreciations (15 min): each person calls out a peer contribution from the past sprint. Builds psychological safety and recognition.

## Medium activities (1–3 hours)

- Hackday / Innovation Sprint (4–8 hours, often a day): timeboxed hack to prototype an idea. Outcomes: demos, lightweight PRs, and cross-team collaboration. Remote: coordinate via repo labels and async demo videos.
- Brown-bag learning (60–90 min): informal lunch talk where an engineer or guest presents. Record and store slide notes for later.
- Problem workshop (2 hours): pick a recurring team problem, map root causes, brainstorm experiments and owners.

## Offsite / Half-day agenda (3–4 hours)

- Kickoff: context and desired outcomes (15 min)
- Icebreaker: short activity to warm up (20 min)
- Collaborative workshop: solve 1-2 cross-team problems with breakout groups (90 min)
- Demos & showback: teams present takeaways (45 min)
- Next steps & commitments: assign owners and quick wins (20 min)

## Remote-friendly practices

- Use small breakout rooms for synchronous collaboration; keep sessions focused and timeboxed.
- Provide clear async options: recorded demos, shared notes, and explicit follow-up tasks.
- Make participation low-friction: allow cameras off, use chat reactions, and rotate facilitation to avoid always-defaulting to the same voices.

## Inclusivity and accessibility

- Schedule with timezone overlap in mind; rotate meeting times when teams are global.
- Offer multiple ways to participate (voice, chat, doc-based) and provide pre-read materials for neurodiverse teammates.
- Avoid activities that pressure personal disclosures; make personal sharing optional.

## Measuring impact

- Simple signals: participation rate, number of cross-team PRs after an event, and short anonymous pulse feedback.
- Outcome metrics: reduced handoffs, fewer recurring incidents tied to communication, improved cycle time on cross-team deliveries.

## Budget & logistics

- Small budget items: food for offsites, grants for learning resources, and prizes for hackdays. Track costs per event and tie them to outcomes.

## Quick templates

- Retro prompt: "What worked, what didn't, one experiment for next sprint" (use in 30–45 min sessions).
- Hackday brief: problem statement, success criteria, demo time, and code repo link.
