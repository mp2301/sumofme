# Disclaimer

All configurations, IP ranges, security controls, recovery steps, monitoring criteria, and operational examples in this repository are illustrative. They intentionally omit or generalize environment-specific values (e.g., exact subnets, thresholds, RTO/RPO targets, privileged group memberships, and detection tuning parameters) to reduce security and privacy risk.

Do not copy any example verbatim into production without:
1. Performing a security review and risk assessment
2. Adjusting to your organizations policies, compliance requirements, and architecture
3. Validating in a controlled test environment first

Nothing here establishes warranties, service levels, or operational commitments. Use at your own risk.

If you discover unredacted sensitive data, open a responsible disclosure issue or contact the maintainer privately so it can be remediated.
